## 📈 Clusters in Data Science

In Data Science, **groups of similar data points are called clusters**.

- Usually visualized in a **scatter plot**
- Each cluster represents similar behavior or patterns

Example:
- Group of customers with similar buying habits
- Group of students with similar performance
