# Data Science Techniques

Data Science uses different techniques depending on:

- Traditional data  
- Big data  
- Business Intelligence  
- Machine Learning  

---

## 📊 Understanding Data Flow

### Raw Data → Processed Data → Information

- **Raw data** = unprocessed facts  
- **Processed data** = cleaned and structured  
- **Information** = meaningful output used for decisions  

👉 Raw data cannot be analyzed directly.

---

## 📥 Data Collection

### Primary Data
Collected directly through:

- Surveys  
- Website cookies  
- Monitoring user activity  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Techniques

After data collection:

### ✔ Fix incorrect data entries  
### ✔ Handle missing values  
### ✔ Data cleansing (remove inconsistencies)

---

## 🔢 Types of Data

### Numerical Data
- Can be mathematically manipulated  
- Example: age, income, number of complaints  

### Categorical Data
- Cannot be mathematically manipulated  
- Example: gender, country, date (often treated as category)

---

## ⚖ Data Balancing
Taking equal samples from each group to avoid bias.

---

## 🔀 Data Shuffling

Used to:

- Prevent unwanted patterns  
- Improve predictive performance  
- Avoid misleading results  

---

## 🗃 Traditional Data Techniques

- ER diagrams (for data relationships)  
- Relational schemas  

### Real-life examples:
- Customer records  
- Sales databases  
- Complaint logs  

---

# 🌐 Big Data Techniques

Big data is more complex due to:

- High volume  
- Multiple formats (text, image, audio, video)

### Common steps:

- Advanced data collection  
- Complex preprocessing  
- Wider range of cleansing methods  
- Handling missing values  

---

### 📌 Case-specific Techniques

- Text mining  
- Data masking (protecting confidential info)  
- Combining data from many sources  

---

### 🌍 Big Data Examples

- Facebook storing real-time user activity  
- Financial trading data systems  

---

# 📊 Business Intelligence (BI)

BI = **Data skills + business knowledge**

Focus:

- Explaining past performance  
- Measuring business progress  

---

## 📈 Key BI Concepts

### Metrics
- Measure business progress  
- Used for comparisons  

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
- Linked to main business goals  
- Measure performance over time  

---

### BI Examples

- Price optimization  
- Inventory management  

---

# 📐 Traditional Statistical Methods

### Common Techniques:

- Linear Regression → `Y = bX`  
- Logistic Regression → decision making  
- Cluster Analysis → grouping data  
- Factor Analysis  
- Time Series Analysis  

---

### Real-life Uses:

- User experience optimization  
- A/B testing  
- Sales forecasting  

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning

Machine Learning creates algorithms that:

- Learn patterns from data  
- Build models  
- Make predictions  

Core components:

- Data  
- Model  
- Objective function  
- Optimization algorithm  

Used for complex computational problems.

## 📚 Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled data  
- Like a teacher guiding students  

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data  
- Finds hidden patterns  

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns using reward system  

---

# 🚀 Latest Trends in Machine Learning

- NLP (Natural Language Processing) — chatbots, Siri, assistants  
- Self-supervised learning — large language models  
- Transformers (GPT)  
- Diffusion models  
- GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)  
- NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)  
- Hybrid models  

---

### Machine Learning Applications

- Fraud detection  
- Client retention  
- Recommendation systems
