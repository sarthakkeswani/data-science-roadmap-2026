## 📁 Types of Data

### 1. Traditional Data
- Structured data  
- Stored in databases, spreadsheets, tables  
- Example: sales records, customer details, transactions  

### 2. Big Data
- Very large and complex datasets  
- Cannot be handled easily by traditional systems  
- Includes text, images, audio, video, sensor data

## 📈 Big Data and the “V” Concepts

Big Data is commonly explained using **3 Vs** (sometimes extended to 5, 6, or more).

### 🔹 Volume
- Massive amount of data  
- Often stored across many computers (distributed systems)

### 🔹 Variety
- Different data formats:
  - Text
  - Images
  - Audio
  - Videos

### 🔹 Velocity
- Speed at which data is generated and processed  
- Focus on quickly extracting useful patterns

(Other Vs sometimes include Value, Veracity, Variability, Visualization, etc.)
